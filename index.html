So they're actually not going to stress all the way to the sides of the browser, but will kind of constrain itself to be a little bit closer to the middle. And basically our entire content of our website is going to sit inside of that container or at least be aligned with this container.

                NAVBAR-RIGHT means I want to still have a navigation bar, but I want it to be pulled to right. I want it to float all the way to the right.-->

An icon font is basically a vector based image that is able to behave in the same way that that the font would behave. In other words you could size it, you could colorize it, give it a color, basically use it the same way you use a font except it's usually some sort of vector based shape .

                we put break between icon and the word meny .we're not just putting a break, we're putting a class on it and we're saying hidden XS which means I want this break to go away when the screen size is extra small.. -->
